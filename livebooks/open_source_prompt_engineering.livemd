# OpenSource LLMs Prompt Engineering

```elixir
Mix.install([
  :req,
  :jason
])
```

## Ollama API Locally

```elixir
defmodule Ollama do
  @timeout 300_000
  @url "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"

  def call(model, prompt) do
    payload =
      Jason.encode!(%{
        "model" => model,
        "prompt" => prompt,
        "stream" => false
      })

    resp = Req.post!(@url, body: payload, receive_timeout: @timeout)

    if resp.status == 200 do
      resp.body["response"]
    else
      inspect(resp.body)
    end
  end
end
```

## Main points for promting LLMs

1. How the LLM was finetuned and packaged behind an API impacts how to prompt it.
2. Different LLMs & LLM versions mean different prompts.
3. Prompting is not software engineering. It's closer to googling.
4. Prompts are just a strings. Do not overcomplicate it.
5. RAG is prompt-engineering. Do not overcomplicate it. It just concatenates strings and adds them to the prompt.

## Let's start with memorable anology

You go out every day with pants on. You see everyone wearing pants. You're told it's right to wear pants. You are a good person for wearing pants.

Every day, you act normal, because you wear pants.

Then, one day, you go out and you're not wearing pants.

**Do you still act normal?**

**Note:** "Wearing pants" is an anology for Prompt Setting.

## Prompt Setting Mistral

```elixir
prompt = "Respond kindly to the child: i really hate zucchini. why should i eat it?"

# prompt setting
# <s>[INST]{text}[/INST]
prompt_with_setting = "<s>[INST] #{prompt} [/INST]"

Ollama.call("mistral", prompt)
|> IO.puts()
```

## Prompt Setting LLama2

```elixir
prompt = "You are a healths food nut. I'm drinking green juice"

# <s>[INST]<<SYS>>\n{system_text}<</SYS>>\n{text}[/INST]
sys_prompt =
  "You are a game desinger and developer of 2D games. You have experience as designer and a javascript developer."

prompt =
  "Give me step by step design of minimalistic Tettris game. I want the design and the instructions of how the game to be implemented to be detailed and complete."

prompt_with_setting = "<s>[INST]<<SYS>>\n#{sys_prompt}<</SYS>>\n#{prompt}[/INST]"

Ollama.call("llama2:7b", prompt_with_setting)
|> IO.puts()
```

```elixir

```
