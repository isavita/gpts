# Mistral AI GPT Models and Elixir Experiments

This repository contains various GPT models created using OpenAI, as well as Elixir livebooks showcasing experiments and examples using these models. Additionally, you will find information on instruction prompts and other relevant details.

## Contents

- `gpt_models/` - Directory containing various GPT models created using OpenAI
  - `model_1/` - Subdirectory for the first GPT model
    - `model_file.pth` - Trained model parameters
    - `config.json` - Configuration file for the model
  - `model_2/` - Subdirectory for the second GPT model
    - `model_file.pth` - Trained model parameters
    - `config.json` - Configuration file for the model
- `elixir_livebooks/` - Directory containing Elixir livebooks with experiments and examples using the GPT models
  - `livebook_1.livemd` - First Elixir livebook
  - `livebook_2.livemd` - Second Elixir livebook
- `prompts/` - Directory containing instruction prompts and other relevant information
  - `prompt_1.txt` - First instruction prompt
  - `prompt_2.txt` - Second instruction prompt

## Usage

To use the GPT models, you can either load them directly into your OpenAI environment or use the provided Elixir livebooks as a starting point for your own experiments.

To run the Elixir livebooks, you will need to have Elixir and the Livebook tool installed on your system. Once you have these prerequisites installed, simply navigate to the `elixir_livebooks/` directory and run the following command:

```
livebook .
```

This will start the Livebook server and open the livebooks in your default web browser.
